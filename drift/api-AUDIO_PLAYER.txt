				AUDIO_PLAYER - High-Level Audio Playback
		
				Simple, high-level audio playback for Eiffel applications.
				Provides one-liner playback and event-driven callbacks.
		
				Usage:
					player: AUDIO_PLAYER
		
					-- One-liner playback (blocking)
					create player.make
					player.play_file ("music.wav")
		
					-- Non-blocking playback with callback
					player.set_on_finished (agent on_playback_done)
					player.play_file_async ("music.wav")
		
					-- Control during playback
					player.pause
					player.resume
					player.stop
		
					-- Volume control
					player.set_volume (0.75)
